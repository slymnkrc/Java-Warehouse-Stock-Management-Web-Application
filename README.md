## Project Details:

In this project, a warehouse's stock management website was designed. To edit the page content, login from the admin panel is required. Session information and cookies are kept during login.

General statistical information is displayed on the homepage. The general balance of the safe and the general information of the stocks are available on this screen. Recently added stock products and last order information are also displayed on this screen. At the same time, buttons for adding customers, adding products, adding orders and payment entry have been added for quick access.

A new customer is registered in the system on the Customers page. There is also a table on this page that includes all customers registered in the system. On this table, deletion, editing and detailed view operations can be performed about the relevant customer.

Product is added to the system from the stock management page. There is also a table on this page with all the products registered to the system. On this table, deletion, editing and detailed view operations can be performed regarding the relevant product.

Sales are made through customers registered in the system on the Orders page. After the customer is selected, the product is selected and the quantity information is entered. The receipt number is automatically generated by the system. As the order is added to the customer, the basket products are dynamically listed in the table on the page. After the add to cart process is completed, the sale is completed.

General cash transactions are displayed on the vault management page. In addition, sales can be made through the customer. From this page, you can also access the cash register entry and exit transactions. Customers and receipt numbers are displayed on the cash entry screen. The debt and payment information of the customer can be displayed by selecting the receipt numbers. The payment transaction information is entered with the selected receipt number. The company's spending information is available on the cash out screen.

With the secure exit button, the session information and cookies are cleared and the session is terminated.

Below are the ready-made admin information registered to the system. You can login to the application with this username and password.
